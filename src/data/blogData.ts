Introduction
Imagine the aroma of freshly baked naan, the smoky essence of tandoori chicken,
and the crisp, golden crust of kulchas—all of these culinary delights share one thing
in common: the tandoor. This traditional clay oven, rooted deeply in the culture of
Punjab, has transcended regional boundaries to become a staple in kitchens and
restaurants across the world. But how did a humble village cooking technique
influence global cuisine? Let’s explore the incredible journey of the tandoor, its
historical significance, and its lasting impact on food culture worldwide.
The Origins of the Tandoor: A Fiery Invention

The tandoor’s history can be traced back thousands of years, with evidence of its
use found in the Indus Valley Civilization (around 2500 BCE). Archaeologists have
unearthed remains of cylindrical clay ovens in ancient settlements like Harappa and
Mohenjo-Daro, suggesting that the people of this era baked bread similar to
modern-day roti and naan.
However, the tandoor, as we know it today, became a defining feature of Punjabi
cuisine during the Mughal era. The Mughals, known for their love of rich, flavorful
food, adopted and refined tandoor cooking techniques, making dishes like tandoori
meats and kebabs famous across the Indian subcontinent. Over time, the tandoor
became an essential part of village life in Punjab, with every home or community
center having one.
Tandoor: More Than Just a Cooking Tool
For centuries, the tandoor wasn’t just a cooking appliance—it was a symbol of
community and togetherness in Punjabi villages. Unlike modern kitchens, where food
is often prepared in isolation, traditional tandoor cooking was a shared experience.
● A Community Affair: In many villages, people would take their kneaded
dough to the communal tandoor to bake rotis or kulchas. The tandoor became
a place for neighbors to gather, share stories, and bond over food.
● A Wedding Ritual: Even today, it is common in Punjabi weddings to have a
‘tandoor night,’ where family members prepare food together as part of the
pre-wedding celebrations.
● A Symbol of Hospitality: Offering freshly made tandoori roti with butter or
ghee is a gesture of warmth and hospitality in Punjabi homes.

The Magic of Tandoori Cooking
What makes tandoori food so unique? It’s all in the science of the cooking process.
The traditional tandoor is a cylindrical clay oven heated with charcoal or wood. When
food is placed inside, it cooks at extremely high temperatures, often exceeding
400°C (750°F). The intense heat sears the food quickly, locking in juices and
creating a delicious smoky flavor that is hard to replicate in a regular oven.
● Tandoori Roti &amp; Naan: The dough is slapped onto the inner walls of the
tandoor, where it sticks and bakes to perfection, getting crispy on the outside
while remaining soft inside.
● Tandoori Chicken: Marinated in a blend of yogurt and spices, the chicken is
skewered and cooked in the tandoor, giving it that signature charred and
smoky taste.
● Seekh Kebabs: Spiced minced meat is molded onto skewers and roasted in
the tandoor, making for a succulent and flavorful dish.
● Amritsari Kulcha: A crispy, stuffed flatbread baked in the tandoor, often filled
with spiced potatoes and served with chole (chickpeas).
The Tandoor’s Journey Beyond Punjab
The spread of Punjabi cuisine across India and the world can be largely attributed to
the partition of 1947. Many Punjabi families, displaced due to the partition, took their
culinary traditions with them as they migrated to different parts of India and beyond.
As a result, tandoori cuisine found its way into street food stalls, dhabas (roadside
eateries), and eventually fine- dining restaurants.
The global appeal of the tandoor grew rapidly in the 20th century:

● Indian Restaurants Worldwide: From London to New York, Indian restaurants
made tandoori dishes their highlight, drawing food lovers from all
backgrounds.
● Fusion Cuisine: The tandoor’s cooking method inspired chefs globally,
leading to fusion dishes like tandoori pizzas, tandoori tacos, and even
tandoori-flavored grilled fish.
● Home Tandoors: In recent years, portable tandoors and electric versions
have made their way into modern kitchens, allowing people to recreate the
authentic flavors at home.
The Modern-Day Tandoor: Adapting to Change
While traditional clay tandoors still hold their charm, modern innovations have made
tandoor cooking more accessible. Gas tandoors, electric tandoors, and even
stainless steel versions are now available, making it easier for home cooks and
restaurant chefs to use this age-old cooking technique. Additionally, with growing
health consciousness, tandoori food has gained further popularity. Since tandoor
cooking requires minimal oil and retains the natural flavors of ingredients, it is
considered a healthier alternative to deep-fried foods.
Conclusion: A Tradition That Keeps Burning
The tandoor is not just an oven; it is a legacy that has stood the test of time. From
ancient Indus Valley kitchens to modern Michelin-starred restaurants, this humble
clay oven continues to be at the heart of some of the world’s most beloved dishes.
Whether it’s a smoky naan, a juicy kebab, or a crispy kulcha, the magic of the
tandoor lives on, bringing people together through the love of food. So, the next time
you bite into a piece of tandoori chicken or scoop up some curry with warm naan,

remember—you are tasting a piece of Punjab’s rich culinary history, a tradition that
has truly shaped global cuisine.

The Lost Math of Kolam
#GenderEquality
Mornings in the southern states of India are much the same as anywhere
else, with only a small twist—women rise before dawn, sweep the thresholds
of their homes, and then sit down to create some of the most intricate
geometric patterns using rice flour.


These designs, known as kolam in Tamil Nadu, rangavalli in Karnataka, and
muggulu in Andhra Pradesh, are more than decorations—they are visual
rituals, mathematical constructions, and carriers of centuries-old
algorithms passed down orally from mother to daughter. Kolams, long
dismissed as folk art or women’s tradition, are now being recognized by
most as ancient knowledge systems that encode geometry, logic, memory,
and computations. They are representatives of an unwritten algorithmic
tradition rooted in aesthetics and cultural symbolism, and interwoven with
the daily lives of the women in southern India.
Decoding Kolams
A kolam is a symmetrical, looping pattern created by dropping tiny dots of
rice flour on the ground and then drawing continuous lines around them in

closed curves. These designs range from simple grids to highly complex
arrangements, all drawn freehand. Kolams are traditionally drawn outside
home entrances, symbolizing auspiciousness, welcoming prosperity, and
warding off evil. They also double as a form of offering to birds and ants,
promoting ideas of non-violence, and sharing. Though ephemeral—
gradually erased by wind, rain, or foot traffic—kolams are redrawn every
day and over time, their patterns become embedded in the cognitive muscle
memory of the women who create them with religious dedication.
A Women-Led Tradition
Kolams at first glance may come across as mere ornamentations; but
upon a closer look, we find embedded within their loops and curves, a
powerful form of mathematical reasoning.
Kolams are built on the foundations of mathematical tools of
symmetry, geometry, and pattern recognition. This is a form of math
that is practiced without formulae or formal instructions. Women,
most of whom have never studied mathematics in schools, intuitively
develop an understanding of building layered complexities from dot
matrices, constructing repeating motifs using modular transformation
and other such concepts, through these kolam arts.
Kolams embody algorithms, instructing where to start, where to loop,
where to mirrora shape, and where to end, almost like the rules of
construction in computer science. Kolams’ ingenuity lies in
embedding these rules in hand-drawn form, without ever writing them
down.


Kolams and Computational Thinking In recent decades there has been
a surge in decoding kolams through the lens of computer science. For
instance, Dr. Nagalakshmi and her team at Anna University have
created a software that generates kolams based on input patterns,
thereby reverse-engineering traditional methods into digital codes.
Mathematician Dr.Sriraman went so far as to describe kolams as a
form of graph theory and lattice math practiced long before these
concepts were even formally defined.
Each kolam is an example of visually coded logic and can have
potential applications in fields of robotics, computer graphics, and
generative design. A particularly intriguing subset of kolams is the
pulli kolam, drawn using the dot grid and continuous lines.
Researchers have modelled these kolams as the famous Lindenmeyer
systems— an algorithmic system used to simulate plant growth,
fractals, and other natural forms.
Cultural Memory and Mapping

What makes kolams even more remarkable is that they are often retained
entirely in memory. Women memorise hundreds of different patterns and
reproduce them with unmatched accuracy and creative variation. They need
no notebooks and no sketches. It is almost as if their brain has transformed
itself into a mental library of geometric forms.

Looked at in this way, kolams are mnemonic devices, not much different
from oral epics, or musical ragas, where structure and improvisation coexist
in harmony. For some families, kolam styles are almost like heirlooms,
passed down to the next generation as a part of their cultural heritage, to be
embedded in marriage rituals, festivals, or caste-specific customs.
Kolams of Resistance and Reclamation

Beyond being mathematical wonders, kolams are also layered with social
meaning and richness. Kolas, as a women-led practice, can be seen as
enduring forms of intellectual labour of the women, which traditionally has a
long history of being ignored by patriarchal and colonial systems of
knowledge.
Women were rarely given a place to shine in formal sciences, but in the
yards of their homes, they quietly practiced algorithms, encoded memory,
and mapped symmetrical logic every single day. Kolams were perhaps their
own unconscious efforts to exert their importance in a field which had long
been reserved exclusively for males.
In recent years, feminist scholars have reinterpreted kolams as silent
struggles against the continued effort to erase and undermine women’s
intellectual contributions, as a claim to space and knowledge, and as
language for the marginalized, especially in rural and Dalit homes, where
kolams have their own unique and unconventional forms.
Drawing the Line from Past to Future
In the face of the ever-looming threat of globalization, where hand-drawn
kolams are increasingly being replaced by vinyl stickers or printed mats,
many young artists are now looking to revive kolam traditions through digital
art, workshops, and coding platforms. These efforts have taken the forms of
kolam-generating apps, workshops integrating kolams with coding to raise
interest among the younger generations, interactive art installations, like
those by artist Ranjani Shettar, and even the use of kolams in artificial
intelligence to train models in pattern recognition and design. Kolams are
cultural algorithms and maps of memory, math, and meaning.


They represent an ancient knowledge system, formalized not in books, but
breathing through repetition, touch, and the rhythm of everyday life. By
honouring kolams we acknowledge the intellectual labour of countless
unnamed women who practiced complex ideas in simple spaces—without
calling it science, yet embodying it with elegance. In a world panting after
complex coding and algorithms, perhaps we should first pause and look at
the ground beneath our feet. It is there, in rice flour drawings glistening in
the morning light, that we find a wisdom we are only beginning to fathom.

Childhood Rituals
(rituals childhoodrituals belonging)

word count 1023
I grew up in nineties Bombay. A Bombay that was going to soon be called Mumbai, a
Bombay that was going to see the greatest impact of India embracing globalisation,
a Bombay which was at the peak of her ‘sapno ka shehar’ attitude and owning it with
full Bambaiyya swag.
More importantly it was for me a secure space where I grew up within the safety of
certain childhood rituals under my paternal grandma, Papama’s protective care.
Here, I share with you a few of these rituals which for some reason seem to have
been left behind in those growing up years.
Ubtan Bath
“Uddak bhochi taaaplyaa, zauke maa” Papama cautions the 4 yr old me about the
hot bath water as I await my special “yellow” bath. I stand bare in the small bathroom
, awaiting Papama to finish preparing the ubtan mixture of gram flour , turmeric and
milk in the kitchen which is adjacent to where I am standing feeling a bit bored. I
begin tracing my name on the white tiles of the bathroom wall which are covered with
water droplets. This is a newly acquired skill, one which I am excited to master.
‘Hanngaa yaw ma” Papama beckons me towards her as she enters the bathroom.
She swiftly gives the ubtan a final mix and begins applying it on my face followed by
my arms, legs, torso and back. If I think about it now, the scent of the ubtan along
with the steam in the bathroom makes for a saun like environment.
The 4 yr old me however says ouch Papama as the rough texture of the ubtan
cleanses and purifies my skin. “Vattantu khelnu kashi zallya pale’ Papama gently
admonishes me for playing in the hot sun for far too long. “Vaggi kari nave\`’ I plead
with her to rinse off the ubtan quickly. She dunks the copper chambu into the
stainless steel bucket, checking that it is just right - neither too hot nor toos old. Once
satisfied she asks me to shut my eyes and begins pouring chambu after chambu of
hot water over my head. My body is thoroughly soaped and washed. My best part is
about to happen. As the water in the bucket reaches the very bottom, she keeps the

chambu aside, lifts the bucket and pours the rest of the water on my head. The gush
of water over me thrills me every time . Before I can even open my eyes properly,
Papama wraps me in a bhairaas and leads me out of the bathtooom to get changed.
Plaits
8.05 am every school morning, Papama braids my curly frizzy hair. She invariably
has just five minutes to do this because my school bus arrives promptly at 8.10am
and if I am lucky at 8.12am. Papama never seems to be fazed by the time pressure.
She is confident and efficient. She oils my hair generously to which I always
complain ‘my friends will call me chip-chip chokhri”. “Ignore kari tanka” Papama asks
me to ignorethem.
I wish it was that easy I think to myself. Teenage girls can be rather nasty
but how can I explain this to Papama now?
Her voice interrupts my thoughts. “Tel ghalka baa,barenchi te” she tries to reason
with me by saying oiling my hair is in fact beneficial for it. I sullenly agree as I need
my hair to be tied into neat plaits and time is of essence. I make a mental note to talk
to her about this after school. I can see my brother ready to leave for school. I can;t
help but be envious of how he doesnt have to go through this hair braiding malarkey.
I see my school bus turning around the corner. “Bus aayle papamaaaa”, I scream
asshe is tying the end of my second plait with a bright red ribbon. “Vhaee gottasa”,
shereplies calmly . “Gadbadi kornakkkaaa”, she tells me not to panic. She quickly
hands me my school bag and water bottle and with blessings and love waves me
goodbye.
Kelay Hashale Sliced banana dunked in a bowl of cold milk and sprinkled with
powdered sugar was an after school snack that I looked forward to as soon as I got
off the school bus. Haath paay dhuyi anni vaggi yaw khavnchak. Papama’s voice
greeted me every single day. She would be busy preparing this snack for me as I
entered home after a long school day.

I was sweaty, tired and hungry and kaley hashaley was the perfect pick me up
snack. The cold milk, soft banana and sweetness from the sugar energised me
almost immediately. One day we ran out of bananas and the 5 year old me threw a
massive tantrum. I wanted kaley hashale and nothing else. Even a slice of chocolate
cake would not do. Papama was in a dilemma. I was refusing to eat - a relatively
new problem as I have always been one of the most non fussy eaters around
according to my family at least. My incessant crying ended up waking Ajju from his
afternoon nap. Without saying a word, he got dressed and stepped out of the house.
Papama wondered where he went but was far too distracted by my antics. She tried
telling me a joke, showing me my favourite book and switching on my favourite
cartoon on television. Nothing worked.
Her methods to calm me down seemed to be failing miserably. Soon after, Ajju
returned with a handful of bananas and handed them to Papama who was very
relieved. She quickly made the hashale and as soon as she fed me a spoonful, I
instantly became quiet. Kaley hashale for me was comfort food - a significant part of
my daily routine. It provided me with a strange sense of belonging to my home.
Without it, the afternoon was different and for the 5 year old me, dealing with change
was hard. So I latched onto the kaley hashale like an anchor. Even today, when I find
myself dithering and unsettled, I know what I reach out for almost subconsciously -
banana, milk and sugar.

तामाहरूलाई सराप दिएर साधु राक्षसको खोजीमा जुगा घारीमा आइपुगे। "जुगा हो! कुनै
राक्षसलाई यताबाट गएको दे"बाँसका तामा हो! कतै राक्षसलाई मारेको पशुसित यताबाट
गएको देख्यौ कि?"
साधुको सोधाइमा तामाहरूले भने- "हामी राक्षसको हौं र उस्तो कुरो सोध्छस्? हामीलाई
चाहिँ कहिले बढ़ेर त्यो नीलो आकाश छुऔंला भन्ने आतुरी छ, तेरो जस्तो गयो गएन,
खायो खाएन चियो गर्ने बानी छैन जा....।"
तामाहरूको फुटानी सुनेर साधुले सराप दिए- "आजदेखि उसो तँ तामाहरूले कलिलैमा
दया-मायाबिना पशुहरूले चिथोख्यौ कि?"

Brewing Beer And
Memories


Aliya and her cousins were travelling back from Delhi to their hometown in Arunachal​
Pradesh. Aliya had bought her naniapiya (father’s elder sister) a jewellery box from
Janpath​
and a set of flavoured beer from a shop in Safdarjung, an area famous for

Northeastern​
cuisine. As they sat on the bamboo floor exchanging pleasantries Aliya’s naniapiya
was​
mixing rice spreaded on a tarpaulin sheet with an aluminium ladle. ​
Naniapiya. Ini mein nu gebane aecha gifts lowada. Aathu.​
Ohh. Aecha kesha mein taando! Thank you ah. Aecha aesya? Yu hunji aathu da.​
Aecha mein flavoured yu dumo. Yu ajihone nu aecha ma fruit flavour aetehone
ichibu topra​
mein taando baida. Aathu aecha Kiwi chi, aecha mango flavour. ​
Naniapiya. We have bought gifts for you. Please have a look.​
Ohh. These are beautiful. Thank you dear. What is this? This looks like Yu.​
Yes it is. It is a set of flavoured yu (rice beer). When the rice beer is made it is mixed
with​
fruit syrup and fruits flavours and then we can drink delicious flavoured fruit beer.
See this​
one is made up of Kiwi, and this one is a mango flavoured drink.​
As naniapiya nods at the explanation she cannot help but remember how the
process of​
brewing yu used to be a household chore which connected households through
barter system​
and merrymaking. Yu is seen as a necessary part of village and community
festivities. Local​
glutinous rice cultivated in the farm is half boiled along with red rice. Naniapiya says
the red​
rice is Mishinge jijiko. The name of this variant of red rice might have been derived
from an​
indigenous collection of rice of the species Oryza sativa, known as Jijiko from Tirap
district.​
Another possibility is another type of variant found in Lohit district which is nearer to
their​
district of Lower Dibang Valley. The name of the variant is Jijikong (Ahu) of the same​

species. One of the ways in exchange in rice varieties and names could have been
a result of​
weekly markets held in villages and barter system. ​
As the local white rice is half boiled and mixed with the red rice it produces a
nutty, starchy​
aroma. The rice is spreaded evenly on a carpet until it has cooled down
substantially. Then​
the Pa is broken down into fine powder and mixed with the rice. Pa is a rice
cake consisting​
of yeast that will help the rice to ferment. It is made out of uncooked rice paste
which is​
mixed with old rice cakes consisting of yeast or local herbs which fastens the
fermentation.​
These small rice cakes are shaped into small disks which can be stored for
months. ​
Naniapiya recalls “ Nga ichikihi ho nani so paku ne inane, oko ma pehiyo, pa ajigai
chi. Pa​
ajite hiyo, aashunu ma brushutu aehiyo, aaya gibene aamegaichida. Aaya ho Pa
khege ma​
prage lagaichi, aechaho Pa amuni babuda. Hu chi hone khepetya chiyada. Nga
ichiga​
bihitone Bizari iiho, ayahobu nga aatiko chi nani aalombro so inyime pa ajigai da. Pa
aji​
hone jigaiho ini yaku alombro mein jipa jeene oko chi lagaiji, aatiko chi, anapra chi
lagaiji.​
Baha chi taju bu lagaiji, aai aene jigachida.
Buge mein ini mein Bizari ne Pa ajite hayo Dambuk ma amewdane aagugaichida.
Nga hone,​
ichibu nani khe kani hone Dambuk bojaar aagugaichida. Bojare pa aakhahogaicha
imu mein​
taando pa lowdane ini maanu ma dega banaba. Ini chi pa wa mosa alombro mein​

londogahiba. Baha aashunuge pa amehiyo, aaga kani kiku gine aegaichim. ​
“When I was young Whenever we used to return from our fields we would start
making pa.​
We would make enough that could be stored in our baskets and sell it in the
markets, some​
people used to come at home to buy it and we would also visit houses in our village.
The cost​
of selling one pa was 1 Rs. Now it has increased to 10 Rs. When I got married I had
to shift to​
my husband’s village which is Bizari. I used to make pa along with the village nani
(mothers).​
We used to talk about our households, childhood, food and much more. Then after
we made​
and filled our baskets with pa we would go to the market which was at Dambuk. One
day as​
we went to the market, we opened our baskets and displayed our pa for customers
and​
suddenly all the people in the market surrounded us. It was so crowded. Hands
jutting out​
money in exchange of a dozen pa. It was amusing. Most of our customers were Adi
(another​
tribe residing in Siang, East Siang, Upper Siang, West Siang, Lower Dibang Valley
and Lohit​
districts). Maybe because most of them lived in Dambuk too. ​
In the olden days mothers would fill baskets of pa and travel to villages and markets
in the​
morning. By evening they would return back with two baskets of grains and pulses.”​
After Pa is mixed with the rice it is evenly spread again. When the rice cools down it
is stored​
in aluminium or steel beakers. The speed of the fermentation process usually
depends on the​
temperature and season. During winter season it takes more than two weeks for the

rice to be​
properly fermented while in summer the process may be completed in a week. ​
People believe drinking Yu in small quantities help in regulating low blood
pressure and​
digestion. Although Yu is harmful when consumed heavily, it is also an
integral process of​
traditional cooking technique. Rice beer, Apong, Zutho, Chuwak, Yu whatever
the name be it​
has connected several people with love and appreciation for tribal cooking
and culture. When​
resources were scarce and means of leisure almost none, drinking Yu and
sharing stories,​
enjoying some hours before lulling into sleep was a social outlet for men and
women alike to​
enjoy the simple pleasures of life. ​

Bishnu Sendra
Parv(Hunting Festival)
#traditionalfestival#clim
ate#indigenousfestival
___________________________________
A hunting festival called Bishnu Sendra Parv is celebrated by tribals of
Chotanagpur Plateau. The indigenous communities participating in it are
called Santhal, Bhumij, Munda, Ho, Birhor and Kharia. In a particular date,
the men and women of these communities enter the Dalma Wildlife
Sanctuary situated in Jharkhand. This sanctuary is spread in an area of 192
km. In the hot month of Indian May, the Sendra Parv’s date is fixed by the

king of these communities. He is called Dalma king and is christened the
surname Hembrom. He observes executive monarchywithin the community.
Before we discuss the hunting rituals of these indigenous communities let us
discuss the Dalma Sanctuary.
DALMA
—----------------
Dalma is situated about 30 km from the steel city Jamshedpur. Dalma has
gotten its name from the local goddess Dalma Mai. This goddess is
worshiped by the adjoining village people of the sanctuary.
Dalma is a hotspot for ecotourism.
The river Swarnarekha runs along the length of the sanctuary and gives
birth to several scenic waterfalls within the scape. The forests of Dalma
mainly are divided into Dry peninsular sal andNorthern dry mixed with
deciduous forests. The flora has a varied richness of the climbers, herbs,
shrubs, orchids. Some medicinal plants too participate in the fauna list such
as Anantmula, Shatavari, Sarpgandha etc. The sanctuary is an abode for
Asiatic elephants. The largest number of tourists come with the intention of
watching the herds of them from a close distance. Apart from the famous
unofficial elephant sanctuary tag, large varieties of wild animals are also
found here. Such as barking deer, sloth bear, porcupines, mouse deer,
Indian giant squirrels, pangolins, mongooses, wild boar, wild buffalo too can
be sighted in the sanctuary.
Domestic birds such as falcons, gray hornbills, paradise fly catchers, magpie
robins, egrets, mynas, Indian tree pie, Indian peafowl, different varieties of
kingfishers, herons, racket tailed drongo, golden oriole etc can be spotted in
the sanctuary. The migratory birds that fly over the various water bodies

surrounding Dalma hills from Siberia and other cold countries in November.
These birds begin to return from mid-February. Species such as Ferruginous
duck, Eurasian Wagon, Red Crested Pochard, Common Pochard, Taiga
Flycatcher, and Black Bittern.
The Dalma Sanctuary has no safari but foot trails envelope this shortcoming
with higher degrees of grace. The trails are carefully marked by the forest
department authorities for visitors to enjoy the natural beauty. A forest
guide usually accompanying the wildlife enthusiasts helps them for a
thorough understanding and enjoyment.
Sendra Parv Rituals Analysis
—----------------------------------
This tradition’s history is undated and has come down from generation to
generation. These indigenous communities are Polytheist. The tribes not just
of Jharkhand but from adjacent bordering states such as Odisha, Bihar,
West Bengal too join them. This occasion is celebrated under just one
leadership of the Dalma King.
This festival’s relevance and ostentisity can be understood from the fact
that the people beyond their community are invited to partipate and it
depends upon the intelligibility of the said person to either participate or skip
the event.
The whole ritual begins by a meeting at their King’s residence or any
village’s primary school ground or at the courtyard of a village’s temple. A
fallen palm leaf[called as gira sakam] is given to everyone whose presence
is anticipated in Sendra. This is a traditional tribal invitation method followed
till date. More than 10,000 people participate in this hunting festival.

On the first day the cleaning of their temple is completed. Next day, a
praying ceremony is observed in the temple. The beginning is marked by
gathering around a bonfire to offer prayers to their god Bonga Buru. They
sing and dance to their traditional and indigenous songs. The next day, the
men and women ascend the Dalma hills with the intentions of attacking and
hunting in the Dalma Sanctuary. The hunters do not use modern
ammunitions like nets, guns, noose etc.
The villagers take the ancient and traditional weapons like bows and arrows,
farsa[ battle axes ], axes, bejar [dagger], lathi-danda[sticks] and enter the
forest beating their traditional drums and chanting holy hymns. With these
weaponaries they hunt animals like birds to wild buffaloes. After their
hunting culminates, the people gather again at some clearing to settle any
dispute within the tribal society of the entire region throughout the year. The
decisions are pronounced in front of their local god Dehri Baba.
Since hunting is now widely considered illegal in almost every country of the
world for the risk of extinction of the endangered and both species who are
found abundant, the amalgamation of the motley communities is lessening
year-by-year. Every year the forest department runs social and
environmental awareness programmes in the local markets and the villages
showcasing them the danger of ecological imbalance.
During the time of this hunting festival a tight vigil is observed at the
possible locations serving as entryway for them. Use of patrol teams
continuously touring the sanctuary to prohibit them from entering the forest.
Still sometimes, as they are well acquainted with the area’s nook and
cranny, the people sneak through the rough terrain areas to continue this
ritual of hunting. Albeit with time those who have understood the urgency of
forest habitat equilibrium, perform the symbolic ritual of hunting i.e. after
the worshipping, animal hunting is on a rapid rate of decline.

My ‘boring’ traditional attire was never ‘boring’ at all

Packing for college was an exciting activity for Imu considering that this was going to
be her​
first time leaving her hometown of seventeen years and going to a college in
another state. As​
her stomach filled with a heavy sense of impending doom; probably because of
excitement​
and jittery nerves, she did a double check on all her belongings packed in her brown
trolley​
which her elder sister had packed.​
Eeee! Aecha aesya? Ngada. Nga aecha thuwe gimbaw gumda! ​
Aecha nu chi Etopolo ni Thuwe. Naniapiya mein college gimbana laada. ​
Eeee. Ngada. Kesha gum. Nga gimbaw gum.​
Yoh! Gimbana.​
Ngada. Ngada. Ngada!!​

Eee. What is this? No! I am not taking this thuwe with me.​
This is your Etopolo and Thuwe. Naniapiya has told you to take it with you to your
college.​
Eeee. No. This is not even pretty. I am not taking it.​
Oh c’mon. Take this with you.​
No. No. No!!​
But after multiple back and forth between the two sisters which lasted for more than
half an​
hour the result was final. Imu would be taking her ‘boring’ traditional Etopolo (top)
and​
Thuwe (wrap around skirt) with her to college. Although Imu had kept her end of the
bargain​
she promised herself she would not be taking these clothes out from her bag any
time soon. ​
College started and so did new adventures and lessons. Days turned into weeks
and weeks​
into months and soon it was the Indigenous Faith Day of Arunachal Pradesh. In the
midst of​
tribal students excited to flaunt their traditional attire Imu found herself nervous at
the​
thought of wearing hers. ​
The idu mishmi textile pattern consists of simple geometric shapes which are
decorated with​
smaller colourful shapes. The primary colours used in Idu Mishmi textiles are Black,
dark or​
bright orange, white. Different cloth pieces have different colour themes. For
instance- when​
weaving a traditional Thuwe which is a wrap around skirt the colours used are
mostly black,​
dark or bright orange, white and shimmering yarn is also used for embellishments.
The​
design on a Thuwe is weaved on a black background with rows of diamond shaped

motifs​
filled with smaller diamonds in shiny silver, white or brighter colours of green or
bright​
orange. A traditional everyday Etoma , a coat also has the same colour scheme as
the Thuwe.​
Another coat known as Anatubru is a more colourful version consisting of bright
yellow​
rectangular strips with black, red and green geometric shaped embroidery. The
warrior coat​
known as Etondre is made out of thicker yarn or wool. It is mostly in a symmetrical
black and​
white design. ​

In the earlier days the Idu Mishmi people would use nettle plants to make yarn and
natural​
plant dyes for the colours. Every loom set was different and had multiple
components for​
multiple attires. Since the clothes were curated out of natural raw products it was a
time​
taking process taking up to four to five months. Thus each clothing piece was
appreciated and​
cost a lot. When Imu was in high school she remembered how her naniapiya
weaved different​
sets of Thuwe for different occasions. The simpler ones made mostly out of one
single colour​
could be weaved in a week and would cost around 1000- 1500 Rs. While the ones
which had​
Joṉ (embroidery/ weaving designs) were much costlier considering the amount of
time and​
precision it took to complete one. The cost of the latter would start from 3000- 6000
Rs. ​
Imu remembered how she had to accompany her aunty during the initial phase of
setting up​

the wooden loom for weaving. She would pass the ball of black yarn to her aunty
who would​
be sitting in front of the loom; one hand waiting for the ball at point A and passing it
to the​
other hand through the horizontal opening at point B. As the duo repeated this
process till a​
black piece of desired outcome could be seen they would be sharing anecdotes
from everyday​
life, incidents of great curiosity, home remedies and life lessons from school and the
farm.​
As the D-day approached, Imu found herself contemplating if her attire would be
pretty​
enough or if it would be too plain and simple. A pinch of nervousness and a bucket
load of​
hopefulness later Imu looked at herself in the mirror. She looked pretty. Why did she
think​
her clothes made her ugly? Perhaps it looked boring to her because she had always
seen it be​
made out of simple balls of yarn and had worn it multiple times on multiple
occasions that​
she forgot how colourful it was and how beautiful her clothes made her feel. She
was wearing​
a lekopo, a traditional necklace made out of small white beads and bigger red
beads, her​
silver earrings or andisu and her aakuchi (purse) made her resemble her naniapiya,
her​
mother’s elder sister.​
Mimi, her Adi friend, was also wearing her traditional attire of Ulta Galuk (top) of a
dark​
black colour and Gale (wrap around skirt) of a bright red colour with horizontal thin
black​
rows. Her look was complimented with a traditional necklace Aane, made up of
silver coins​

and beads. ​
As the two friends joined their classmates all adorning their traditional attires with
pride and​
gusto, Imu realised how important her clothes made her feel. Every attire was
different,​
colourful and beautiful. Each attire had a story to tell and a tradition to be preserved
and​
proud of. She was part of a connection between her traditional roots and the modern
world.​
Her embarrassment crumbled as she paraded hand in hand with her peers, the sun
shining​
brightly at the ongoing procession and a smile breaking into her young heart. ​

In the realm of design, empathy is not just a crucial principle; it’s the cornerstone. It
enables designers to comprehend people’s feelings and experiences, empowering
them to craft solutions that deeply resonate with users.
This concept has deep roots in philosophy, where thinkers have long emphasized
the significance of understanding others’ perspectives. For designers, this
understanding is indispensable, as they strive not only to create functional designs
but also ones that genuinely connect with their audience.
Empathy isn’t merely a theoretical notion; it’s a practical imperative woven into every
stage of the creative process. From initial research to prototyping, empathy guides
designers, ensuring that their creations are rooted in a profound understanding of
users’ needs and desires. It all begins with a sincere curiosity and a readiness to
immerse oneself in the lived realities of those they design for.
The Role of Empathy in Design
Empathy isn’t just a theory for designers; it’s a practical tool they use throughout
their work. They start by listening to and observing the people who will use their
designs. This means putting aside their own ideas and really trying to understand
what users need and want. Once they have this understanding, they can start

coming up with ideas that fit the users’ needs and situations. Empathy also helps
designers improve their designs by involving users in testing and getting their
feedback.
Design as a Means of Understanding
Design isn’t just about making things look good; it’s about understanding people and
their experiences. Philosophers like John Dewey and Richard Shusterman have
talked about how philosophy can help us understand the world better. For designers,
this means constantly testing their ideas and making sure they work in real life.
In India, designers face unique challenges because of the country’s
diversity. They need to understand the different cultures, languages, and
lifestyles of people across the country. This includes both urban and rural
areas, as well as people from different socioeconomic backgrounds. By
understanding these differences, designers can create solutions that work
for everyone.

Litti Chokha: A Culinary
Treasure Rooted in
Ayurveda and
Sustainability

Introduction: More Than Just a Street Food
What if I told you that one of Bihar’s most beloved street foods is also a powerhouse
of Ayurvedic nutrition? Litti Chokha, a dish often associated with rustic flavors and
roadside eateries, is far more than just comfort food. It is an Ayurveda-approved
meal that has sustained farmers, warriors, and travelers for centuries, offering a
perfect balance of nutrition, energy, and sustainability.
While modern food trends emphasize organic eating, balanced diets, and
sustainability, this humble dish from Bihar has been following these principles for
generations. Litti Chokha isn’t just food; it’s a story of heritage, health, and harmony
with nature.
Let’s explore how this simple yet powerful dish aligns with Ayurvedic wisdom,
its cultural significance, and why it deserves a global spotlight.
The Origins: A Meal of Warriors and Farmers
Litti Chokha traces its roots to the Magadha Empire (6 th century BCE), one
of the most powerful kingdoms in ancient India. It is believed that Magadhi
soldiers relied on Litti because:
It was lightweight and easy to carry during long journeys.
It required minimal cooking resources—just a fire to roast the Littis.
It provided long-lasting energy without refrigeration.
Over time, this simple yet effective dish became a staple among farmers
and laborers due to its cost-effectiveness, high nutritional value, and
ability to stay fresh for hours.
Even today, Litti Chokha remains a symbol of resilience and
self-sufficiency, making it one
of Bihar’s most cherished dishes.

Litti Chokha and Ayurveda: A Perfectly Balanced Meal
Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, emphasizes a diet that
balances the three
doshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Surprisingly, Litti Chokha is designed in
such a way that it
helps in balancing these energies.
Litti: A Nutritional Powerhouse
Litti consists of wheat flour balls stuffed with sattu (roasted gram flour), herbs, and
spices, then roasted over an open fire.
Let’s break down its Ayurvedic significance: Sattu (Roasted Gram Flour):
High in protein and fiber, sattu aids digestion, boosts energy, and keeps the body
cool. It is beneficial for Pitta dosha, helping in detoxification and preventing acidity.
Whole Wheat Flour: A great source of complex carbohydrates, ensuring a
slow energy release and better digestion.
Provides warmth in winters, making it suitable for Vata dosha. Ajwain (Carom
Seeds) &amp;
Jeera (Cumin): Helps in gut health and prevents bloating, making it ideal for
Kapha balance.
Mustard Oil: Used in both Littis and Chokha, it improves digestion, is
antibacterial, and generates warmth—ideal for Vata and Kapha doshas.
Chokha: A Smoked Delight with Medicinal Benefits Chokha is a mashed
vegetable side dish made of roasted brinjals (eggplants), tomatoes, potatoes,
and green chilies. Ayurveda recognizes each of these ingredients for their
healing properties:
Brinjal (Eggplant): Rich in antioxidants, great for blood circulation and
detoxification. Helps in balancing Kapha and Pitta doshas.

Tomatoes: A natural source of Vitamin C, boosting immunity and aiding
digestion. Helps in detoxification and skin health.
Garlic &amp; Green Chilies: Known for their anti-inflammatory properties,
aiding in digestion and boosting metabolism. The combination of smoky
flavors, earthy spices, and fresh ingredients makes Litti Chokha not only
delicious but also a medicinal meal that heals the body from within. A Meal for
All Seasons One of the unique aspects of Litti Chokha is its seasonal
adaptability. Unlike modern fast foods, which have a fixed nutritional profile,
this dish naturally adjusts to different weather conditions.
Summer: Sattu cools the body and prevents heat strokes. The high fiber
content ensures better digestion and hydration.
Winter: Mustard oil and wheat provide warmth, keeping the body cozy during
cold months. The protein-rich sattu ensures higher energy levels in winter.
Sustainability and Simplicity: A Meal for the Future At a time when the world is
looking for eco-friendly food solutions, Litti Chokha stands out
As a sustainable dish:​
* Minimal Cooking Fuel Required – Traditionally, Littis are roasted over cow
dung cakes or wood fire, reducing dependency on gas or electricity.​
* No Refrigeration Needed – Due to its simple ingredients, it remains fresh for
longhours without refrigeration.​
*Locally Sourced Ingredients – Every element of this dish is derived from local
farms, reducing carbon footprint.​
* Zero Waste Cooking – Unlike modern processed food, there is minimal food
waste in​
making Litti Chokha.​
*This makes it not just a heritage dish, but also an eco-friendly future food
option.
A Heritage Dish with a Global Future
In recent years, Litti Chokha has gained international recognition. With an increasing
interest in organic and plant-based diets, this dish is now finding its place in:
Fine-dining restaurants experimenting with gourmet versions. Health-conscious diets
promoting sattu as a superfood. Vegan and vegetarian cuisine, as it’s naturally
plant-based. Despite its simplicity, Litti Chokha remains deeply cultural, nutritionally

rich, and environmentally sustainable—a rare combination that makes it worthy of
global appreciation.
Final Thoughts: Bringing Back Forgotten
Traditions
In our rush towards fast food and processed meals, we often overlook the wisdom of
our ancestors. Litti Chokha is a testament to how traditional diets were naturally
aligned with health, sustainability, and Ayurveda.
So, the next time you enjoy a plate of Litti Chokha, remember: You’re not just eating
a meal; you’re embracing centuries-old wisdom. You’re choosing a dish that
nourishes your body and respects nature. You’re indulging in a food tradition that
deserves to be celebrated globally.

Timekeeping Before Clocks: Tracing Ancient Indian andBengali
Timekeeping Traditions
#Traditional Knowledge
"Time was once told by tides and twilight, sung by birds, and whispered by
the wind—long before clocks dared to measure it."
Much before the mechanical clock became a reality, civilisations relied on indigenous
methods to track time. From celestial observations to water clocks, the human need
to organize daily life, agriculture, and rituals gave birth to unique timekeeping
techniques. This was also true for India, especially Bengal, where people wove their
daily lives around indigenous timekeeping methods that married science with ritual
and nature with culture.
In this blog, we delve into the depths of how people in Bengal and the broader Indian
subcontinent crafted their way of knowing the hour—from astronomical calculations
to water clocks, and temple bells to birdcalls—and how traditional methods have still
found a way to retain their presence in cultural practices and continue to persevere

even in the face of the ruthless pace of mechanization that characterizes the world of
today.
Celestial Science: Astronomy and the Panchang
Astronomy played a key role in Indian, and Bengali, timekeeping traditions. The
movements of celestial bodies were meticulously observed and charted to divide the
days and years into meaningful units. Bengal, with its rich tradition of astronomy and
mathematics, had a significant role to play in enriching these early efforts. The
Panchang, which was the traditional Hindu calendar, used the lunar cycle to divide
the year into months named after prominent constellations. This calendar was a
prime example of how important the role of Nakshatras and celestial bodies was in
determining rituals, agriculture, and governance.
Panchang was used for centuries by Bengali scholars and priests to determine
auspicious days for festival dates and agricultural cycles. Bengali astronomy experts
like Raghunath Purushottama refined these calculations to create more accurate
almanacs to guide everyday activities. This led to the introduction of concepts such
as Tithis (lunar days) and Muhurats (auspicious time periods) which were widely
used for religious and social events. Bangabda: Akbar’s Fusion Calendar Another
landmark moment in the history of pre-clock timekeeping in Bengal was the
introduction of the Bengali calendar, Bangabda, which was introduced by Akbar in
1584. This was a unique fusion of Islamic lunar and Hindu solar tenets of
timekeeping.
This helped standardize timekeeping in Bengal, particularly in the case of agriculture,
aligning tax collection periods with region’s seasonal cycles. Ghati Yantra: Measuring
Time with Water  people also developed the Ghati system of timekeeping. These
were water clocks known as Ghati Yantras that would measure the passage of time
through the controlled flow of water from one vessel to another, through units called
Ghatikas. This method was widely used in the Dakshineshwar and Kalighat temples
to signal daily prayer and offering times. They were also widely used to regulate
trade and administrative work in the medieval cities of Murshidabad and Gauda.

Nature as a Clock: Ecological Cues and Cultural Rhythms
During this period in the history of Bengal, we also observe a unique dependence on
biological and environmental cues to measure time. The call of the cuckoo signaled
dawn. The ebb and flow of tides guided the fishermen of Sundarbans in timing their
ventures. He boatmen’s Bhatiyali songs often had references to time and its unique
nature of waiting for none. Even the auspicious Brahma Muhurta—the religiously
important pre-dawn hour—was determined based on celestial movements and the
spiritual and symbolic silence in the natural world. In short, Bengal’s maritime culture
environmental dependence ensured that natural elements, especially rivers such as
the Ganges, the Hooghly, and the Brahmaputra played crucial role in guiding trade,
travel, and daily life.
Bells and Criers: Sound as a Signal of Time
The account of timekeeping Bengal perhaps is not complete without the mention of
an age-old device of signaling time—bells. Mangal Arati, and midday offerings at
temples, big and small, were signaled using bells. In trade towns like Kolkata and
Chandannagar, bells rang to indicate market opening and closing hours. Public criers
often used bells to announce significant events, marking time for communal
activities.
The Colonial Shift: From Cycles to Clocks
With the British, came the European clocks, almost ominously calling time on all the
means and measures of timekeeping that had been prevailing in the land. Water
clocks. gave way to Big Ben-style clock towers and wristwatches replaced sundials.
As times changed, indigenous methods slowly gave way to the more machine-driven
products, and modern inventions steadily overtook traditional knowledge.
Echoes in the Present: The Persistence of Traditional Time

However, all has not been lost. Traditional lunar calendars are still considered an
indispensable part of Bengali households with them being of utmost importance
when it comes to determining auspicious days for sacred rituals and festivals. This
goes on to show ancient timekeeping practices have themselves stood the test of
time. In an increasingly mechanizing world, these methods have somehow still held
on to their relevance. They are reminders of the deep connection between human
societies andnature, the ingenuity of ancient science, and the cultural rhythms that
continue to shape our lives.
Timekeeping is not just a scientific pursuit; it is a practice deeply woven into the
Bengali social structure that has endured quietly in a race defined by the beat of
quartz and atomic seconds. It survives in the ringing of the temple bells, the rhythms
of the tides, and the occasional rustling of the Bengali calendars in every Bengali
drawing room; and it is through preservation of these practices and knowledge
systems that we honour rhythm over rush, and community over clockwork.

उत्तर अमेरिकामा सबैका लागि समान अधिकार स्थापनाका निम्ति काम गरे। यो कथा लेखिएको
समयमा मान्छेहरूलाई छालाको रंगअनुसार बोलाइनु सामान्य थियो।
मध्यपश्चिम क्याम्पसमा मन्तव्य दिन जानु अघि म एक गिलास दुध र एउटा पाउरोटी किन्न भनेर
शहरको एउटा सानो रेष्टुरेण्टमा छिरेँ। रेष्टुरेण्टमा मलाई बेवास्ता गरिदैछ भन्ने थाहा पाउनु निकै बेर
अघिदेखि म बसेको थिइँन, उभिरहेकै थिएँ। करिब दश मिनेट पर्खिसकेपछि मलाई लाग्यो… अब यहाँ
द्वन्द्व, लफडा हुने नै भो। म एउटा कुनातिर गएँ, एकजना वेट्रेसका सामुन्ने उभिएँ ता कि उनले
मलाई वेवास्ता गर्न नसकुन्, अनि भनेँ, “म एउटा पाउरोटी किन आएको, दिनुस्।”
“माफ गर्नुहोला,” उनले भनिन्, “हामी यहाँ तपाईं…..लाई……अँ…. अँ….. गोरो छाला भएका बाहेक
अरू रंगका मानिसलाई सेवा दिन सक्दैनौँ।”

“यहाँको जिम्मेवार व्यक्ति को हो?” मैले उनलाई सोधेँ। उनले मलाई दुई कुराको संकेत दिइन्…
पहिलो, अलि पछाडि उभिएकी एउटी महिलातिर देखाइन्‍ र दोस्रो, आफ्नो चोरी ‌औँलो ओठ अगाडि
लगेर ठाडो पारिन्। दोस्रो संकेतको स्पष्ट आसय उनलाई यो द्वन्द्वमा कुनै हालतमा नमिसाउनु भन्ने
थियो। म सरासर रेष्टुरेण्टको पछिल्तिर कफी बनाउने ठाउँ नजिकै उभिएकी महिलातिर लम्किएँ।
“यो रेष्टुरेण्टमा मलाई सेवा दिन किन सम्भव छैन म थाहा पाउन चाहन्छु” मैले उनलाई सोधेँ।"
“ए… अँ….” उनको बोली लरबरियो। “किनभने… अँ… किनभने… हामी यो शहरमा त्यसो गर्दैनौँ।
यहाँको कुनै पनि रेष्टुरेण्टले गोरा बाहेक अरू रंगका मानिसहरूलाई सेवा दिँदैनन्।”
“ठिक छ, तर किन? त्यसो गर्दा तपाईंका अरू ग्राहक बिच्किन्छन् भन्ने कुरामा तपाईंलाई विश्वास

The plow, in its most basic form, is a tool designed to cultivate and prepare
soil for planting. Its origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations across
the globe, where early farmers recognized the need to break up and loosen the
earth, facilitating the growth of crops. However, the design of these primitive
plows was not a product of pure ingenuity alone; it was deeply rooted in the
local knowledge systems that had evolved over generations of intimate
interaction with the land and its resources.
In regions where wood was abundant, plows were often crafted from sturdy
tree branches or logs, their curved shapes mimicking the contours of the
earth. These designs minimized the strain on farmers while maximizing the
efficiency of the plowing process. In contrast, in areas where wood was
scarce, animal bones or antlers were repurposed to create sharp, durable
plow tips, enabling the tool to slice through even the most stubborn soils.
The materials used in plow construction were not the only aspect
influenced by local knowledge; the design itself was shaped by the unique
environmental conditions of each region. In arid climates, where water
conservation was paramount, plows were designed with narrow blades that
created shallow furrows, minimizing soil disturbance and reducing water

loss through evaporation. Conversely, in regions with fertile, well-watered
soils, broader plow blades were favored, allowing for deeper cultivation and
better aeration of the soil.
Beyond their functional aspects, the primitive plow designs often carried
symbolic and cultural significance, reflecting the deep connection between
agricultural practices and the spiritual beliefs of local communities. Intricate
carvings or decorative elements adorned these tools, imbuing them with a
sense of reverence and respect for the land and its bounty.
Embracing Sustainability through Design Thinking
As we struggle with the urgent need to develop sustainable agricultural
practices in the face of climate change, resource depletion, and population
growth, the principles embodied in the primitive plow design offer valuable
insights. By embracing the concept of local knowledge systems and
integrating them into contemporary design thinking, we can create solutions
that are not only environmentally sound but also culturally relevant and
socially acceptable.
One of the key tenets of sustainable design thinking is the recognition that
solutions must be tailored to specific contexts and environments. The
primitive plow exemplifies this principle, with its designs adapting to the
unique conditions and resources of each region. By studying and learning
from these traditional practices, modern agricultural engineers and designers
can develop tools and techniques that are attuned to the local ecosystems,
minimizing environmental impact while maximizing productivity.
Furthermore, the primitive plow’s emphasis on utilizing locally available and
renewable materials aligns with the principles of circular economy and
resource efficiency — core pillars of sustainable design. By drawing
inspiration from these ancient practices, contemporary designers can create
agricultural tools and systems that prioritize the use of sustainable materials,
reducing waste and promoting closed-loop cycles.

The cultural and symbolic significance of the primitive design of plow also
highlights the importance of social sustainability in design thinking. By
acknowledging and respecting the deep-rooted connections between
agricultural practices and local belief systems, designers can create solutions
that resonate with the values and aspirations of farming communities. This
sense of ownership and cultural relevance can foster greater adoption and
stewardship of sustainable agricultural practices, ultimately contributing to the
long-term viability of these solutions.
Theoretical Underpinnings: Integrating Local Knowledge into Sustainable
Design
The integration of local knowledge systems into sustainable design practices
finds theoretical grounding in various disciplines, including anthropology,
environmental studies, and agricultural sciences.
One influential framework is the concept of “indigenous technical
knowledge” (ITK), which recognizes the wealth of knowledge and practices
that have been developed by local communities over generations of
interacting with their environments. Scholars such as Paul Richards and
Gloria Anetor have extensively studied ITK in the context of agriculture,
highlighting the importance of understanding and incorporating these
traditional systems into modern agricultural development initiatives.
Another theoretical lens that supports the incorporation of local knowledge
is the concept of “agroecology.” Developed by researchers like Miguel Altieri
and Stephen Gliessman, agroecology is a holistic approach to agriculture
that emphasizes the integration of ecological principles and traditional
knowledge systems. By recognizing the intricate relationships between
crops, soil, water, and other elements of the agroecosystem, agroecology

seeks to create sustainable and resilient agricultural systems that are
tailored to local contexts.
Furthermore, the field of “ethnoecology” provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the intricate relationships between human cultures and their
environments. Scholars such as Eugene Hunn and Víctor Toledo have
explored how traditional knowledge systems shape the way communities
perceive, classify, and interact with their natural surroundings, including their
agricultural practices. By understanding these cultural frameworks, designers
can create solutions that are better aligned with the worldviews and values of
local communities.
The primitive plow symbolizes the enduring wisdom and adaptability of local
knowledge systems within agriculture. Rooted in diverse environmental,
cultural, and social contexts, its design principles provide valuable insights
for contemporary sustainable design thinking. By incorporating local
knowledge systems into modern agricultural design processes, we can
develop solutions that are environmentally sustainable, culturally relevant,
and socially acceptable. Theoretical frameworks such as indigenous
technical knowledge, agroecology, and ethnoecology underpin this
approach, stressing the importance of understanding and respecting the
intricate relationships between human communities, agricultural practices,
and ecosystems.
As we endeavor to address the challenges of 21st-century agriculture, it is
essential to draw guidance from the past. The primitive plow serves as a
reminder that true sustainability necessitates a nuanced understanding of
diverse knowledge systems shaped by millennia of human experiences with
the natural world. By leveraging the timeless wisdom encapsulated in tools
like the primitive plow, we can chart a course toward an agricultural future that

blends traditional knowledge with modern innovation, ensuring food security,
environmental stewardship, and cultural continuity for future generations.

এইসব কাল্পনিক বাস্তবতার অকল্পনীয় যাপনকে। তবু এই সব কিছু ব্যতিরেকে সে সফল হতে চেয়েছিল।
কেননা তার সফল হওয়া তার বাবা মাকে আনন্দ দেবে। আনন্দ আসলে কিসে? বেচে থাকায়? মৃত্যুতে?
নাকি জীবন্মৃত হয়ে দদৌড় এ যা আসলে ভুলিয়ে দেয় আমরা বাঁচতে চেয়েছিলাম, যা আসলে ভুলিয়ে দেয় মৃত্যু
বলে ককোন চরম গন্তব্য ছিল ককোনদিন। সে দদৌড়চ্ছে না তবু তাকে নিয়ে কে যেন ললোফালুফি খেলছে, দুমড়ে
মুচড়ে দিচ্ছে তার ভাবনা চিন্তা গুললোকে, তার চাওয়া পাওয়া, তার সম্পর্কের বিন্যাসকে। আসলে সে একটা

thought disorder এ ভুগছে। অন্তত ডাক্তার তাই বলেছেন। অর্থাৎ কিছু ওষুধ কন্টিনিউ করলেই সে হয়ে
যেতে পারে আর পাঁচটা মানুষের মততো। ছছোটবেলায় একবার গাছের তলায় দাঁড়িয়ে পেঁপে পড়ে গেছিল তার
মাথায়। সবকিছু কেমন টালমাটাল মনে হয়েছিল। তীব্র যন্ত্রণার মধ্যে সে অনুভব করেছিল সম্ভব অসম্ভবের
উথাল পাতাল। আবার বাথরুমে ব্ল্যাক আউট হয়ে পড়ে গিয়ে সে অনুভব করেছিল শুন্যতা, এমন শুন্যতা যা
অনুভব করতে দেয় না ককোনকিছু। কিন্তু এবার সে সুস্থ হয়ে যাবে। কেননা ডাক্তারবাবু ওষুধ দিয়েছেন

The Desert’s Alchemy
#LocalSolution
Long before industrial salt refineries cropped up to dominate supply chains globally,
the indigenous communities across their arid landscapes had already mastered the
art of extracting salt, not from seawater, but from the soil beneath their feet. In the
Kutch region of Gujarat, the Agariyas—a marginalized community—are master
practitioners of a soil-based salt harvesting technique that represents a conscious
mix of environmental understanding, indigenous engineering, and economic
resilience. Here we explore how these people, armed with a traditional knowledge
system, turned salinity into a lifeline, and did so through methods that were frugal,
sustainable, and deeply rooted in the workings of nature.

The Rann of Kutch: A Landscape of Extremes
The Rann of Kutch is a salt marsh in western India characterized by one of the most
unique ecosystems in the subcontinent. For the greater portion of the year, it is a
barren, blinding-white desert, continuously exposed to the sun’s scorching rays, but
the monsoons here are a different story. The rains transform this place into a shallow
lake, fed by seasonal rivers and underground saline aquifers. This annual ritual of
flooding and evaporation leaves behind a salt-rich crust ripe for harvesting. It is this
mineral-laden earth, not the sea, that has provided the Agariyas with livelihood for
centuries.
The Agariyas
The Agariyas, as their name suggests, are traditional salt farmers of the Rann. Their
name derives from the word “agar,” meaning “field” where salt is crystallized. For
generations, these families have migrated to the salt plains after the rains retreat and
lived there for eight continuous months, isolated from villages, amenities, and formal
infrastructure. Despite their seasonal isolation, they possess remarkable knowledge
of geology, crystallography, and hydrology. They have an intuitive grasp over
complex salt-harvesting stages such as the depth at which brine can be found, the
ideal temperature and wind conditions for crystallization, evaporation pan designs
that minimize contamination and maximise yield, and so on. Their unconventional
method of salt extraction, therefore, deserves some explaining.
A Different Model of Salt Extraction
India does have a long coastline that produces sea salt in abundance, but Kutch’s
salt a welcome exception. Here the saline water does not come from oceans but
from ancient geological formations beneath the Rann which formed millions of years
ago when geological activity led to the recession of the Arabian Sea. This soil-based
harvesting technique involves identifying brine-rich zones through observation and
ancestral mapping, digging and maintaining bores manually, constructing salt pans,

regulating flow and evaporation through sluice gates and daily adjustments, and
finally, manual harvesting using long wooden rakes and drying platforms.
As can be gauged, this process is physically taxing and requires a sharp eye for
timing. Moreover, it is entirely weather-dependent—something like a sudden storm
can upend months of hard work. Yet, the salt produced is one of the finest and
purest, capable of commanding good markets and prices if it can reach buyers.
However, most Agariyas are ignorant of the vast possibilities and still earn minimal
returns due to lack of consumer knowledge and profit-capturing by middlemen.
What makes their knowledge system so extraordinary is how it seamlessly adapts
natural forces into productive tools to aid in production of salt. The Agariyas use
various environmental cues to ensure proper harvesting. They use wind patterns to
guide evaporation, consider the colour of brine to determine purity—deep green
means rich mineral content, reddish indicates iron presence—use solar intensity and
moon cycles to guide production, and use cow-dung and clay as natural filters and
soil binders in pan construction. Their work may appear rustic and untrained, but
naturally mirror the scientific principles of passive solar distillation, hydraulic
engineering, and environmental engineering.
Lives in Limbo
The Agariyas are responsible for producing over 75% of Gujarat’s salt. However,
despite their deep knowledge and indispensable contribution, they live rather
precarious lives. For decades, they have been treated as encroachers on
government land and denied basic services like electricity, schooling, and basic
healthcare. Their children often must drop out of school owing to their migratory
lifestyle, with little initiative from the authorities to bring them back to school. They
are also susceptible to health risks—continued exposure to salt and sun leads to
skin, eye, and respiratory diseases. They are also forced to work under exploitative
systems with little bargaining powers because most of them work on lands they do
not own, and produce salt over which they have no claim. To make matters worse,
their methods are not “formally recognized” by modern industries, meaning that their

indigenous expertise remains undocumented, undervalued, and runs the risk of
extinction.
Revival and Recognition
In recent years, however, NGOs like the Agariya Heet Rakshak Manch and scholars
from institutions like the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, have started
documenting and preserving their knowledge. These institutions have also started
advocating for the basic rights that the Agariyas have long been denied.
The Agariya community has from within itself birthed new innovations such as
replacing diesel generators with solar pumps, cutting down on costs and emissions,
the establishment of collective marketing platforms to bypass middlemen, and
training programmes to integrate traditional methods with scientific validation. Some
Agariyas are even registering their salt as a GI (Geographical Indication) product,
reclaiming pride and ownership over their ancestral craft.
From Margins to Models
Under an unforgiving sun, an invisible workforce toils away in the cracked terrain of
Kutch, extracting white gold using nothing but generational wisdom, muscle, and
hope. They are more than salt harvesters—they are scientists equipped with
environmental knowledge and unparalleled intuition. To bring their knowledge into
the light is to redefine the meanings of expertise, sustainability, and development—
topics increasingly relevant in today’s climate-stressed world with increasing issues
of water scarcity and soil salinity. Their craft provides alternative models for resource
management, decentralized livelihoods, and equitable economies. Perhaps it is time
we tasted their salt, not just on our tongues, but in our policies, textbooks, and
imagination.

“Just a slap, but he can't hit me." This dialogue from the movie Thappad, directed
by Anubhav Sinha, is not just a dialogue, it’s an inspiration for many women in the
country. I realised this when I met Saraswati Singh, a woman cab driver from Delhi.
"If he beats me once, he will beat me again," she said with conviction, emphasising
that women must first shed the fear that holds them back.
As I booked a cab, I saw the driver’s name as Saraswati on my phone screen. My
internal stereotype, as a man, did not make me question the gender of the driver,
and I assumed it to be the surname of a male driver. But as soon as the cab arrived,
I was surprised to see a woman behind the wheel. I got in, told her the pin, and as
we started moving, curiosity took over. The first question I asked—one she had likely
heard many times before—was, "Chala toh lengi na aap?" (Will you be able to
drive?). I asked humorously, but let’s not forget stereotypes are often masked as
jokes. She smiled and replied, "Aap jab destination pe pahunch jaaye toh is sawaal
ka jawab aap hi dena" (Once we reach your destination, you can answer that
yourself).

Six years ago, Saraswati worked as a domestic help, washing dishes and cleaning
homes to make ends meet. Financial struggles pushed her to look for something
better. That’s when she found out about the Azad Foundation, an organisation that
trains women to become professional drivers. In 2017, she began working as a
driver at the airport. She also drove rental cars for years until she bought her own car
in 2023. Originally from Prayagraj, Saraswati is now a single mother. Her day begins
with preparing her children for school before heading to work. From 2 PM until late at
night, she drives across Delhi, picking up and dropping off passengers, all while
ensuring she earns enough to sustain her family. On how male passengers react to
seeing a woman drive, she says, "Who decides which job is for men and which one
is for women?"
In a world where gender roles continue to dictate professional choices, the Azad
Foundation is challenging stereotypes by training women to become drivers. "We are
a feminist organisation," says Madhubala, who currently heads Azad Foundation
Delhi. "We believe in gender equality and aim to break the patriarchal myth that
women can only engage in traditional professions like making papads, pickles, or
stitching." Since its inception in 2008, the Azad Foundation has been working to
create livelihood opportunities for women by training them as professional drivers.
"Driving has always been perceived as a male-dominated profession," she explains.
"We want to change that by enabling women to take up driving not just as a skill but
as a career." The foundation operates in four cities: Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and
Jaipur. "Currently, there are around 5,000 women drivers across these cities, with
over 100 women employed as drivers with Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC),"
Madhubala shares. The initiative not only challenges traditional gender roles but also
enables financial independence for women from low-income backgrounds. Beyond
public transport, women trained by the foundation are now employed with ride-hailing
services like BlueSmart and delivery platforms such as Zomato, Swiggy, and
Amazon. "There are several gender-based myths about driving, night shifts, and
navigation," she points out. "We are working to dismantle these biases and make the
profession accessible to all genders."
The Azad Foundation does more than just teach women how to drive. It conducts
empowerment sessions that cover topics such as gender discrimination, workplace

readiness, and addressing domestic violence. "Many of the women we work with
have experienced domestic violence," Madhubala says. "We equip them with the
knowledge to identify violence, improve their communication skills, and plan their
way forward." For women who seek legal support, the foundation collaborates with
organisations like JAGORI, and the Delhi Legal Services Authority (DALSA). "While
we don't directly provide legal aid, we connect women with networks that can support
them through legal and emotional challenges," she explains. Saraswati, who was
also subjected to domestic violence, decided one day to leave her abusive marriage.
"Every girl should first remove the fear inside her, the fear of 'what will people say?'"
She acknowledges that the job is not easy. "Earlier, we could hit our daily target in
ten rides. Now, it’s tougher. So I look for shorter rides with better pay." One of the
biggest challenges for not only women passengers but drivers too, is safety,
especially at night. Saraswati doesn’t carry any weapons for protection but takes
precautions. "I avoid going to places like Gurgaon late at night and prefer staying
within city limits," she admits. Despite these challenges, her presence on the road
has inspired many female passengers. Many women passengers tell me that they
feel safer with me, told Saraswati. “Whenever I travel after 9 pm in Delhi, I feel like
my heart is on the brink. Today, I felt so safe with Saraswati, the only female driver in
East Delhi, #Kudos to Saraswati.” wrote a woman passenger on X.
Saraswati Singh’s journey is not just about driving, it’s about survival, strength, and
self-reliance. A survivor of domestic violence, she refused to stay in an abusive
marriage. Instead, she chose the road as her path to independence and dignity.
"Women should step out. It doesn’t matter how much they’ve studied. You learn by
meeting new people," she says. From being a victim of domestic violence to
becoming financially independent, Saraswati is a symbol of resilience. She proves
that when women take control of the steering wheel both in life and on the road, they
carve their path to empowerment. Her advice to other women? “Don’t listen to
anyone. Stay in your lane. Drive slow, drive safe, but drive.”

আমার বাড়ির বারান্দা বেশ নিরিবিলি, দিনের বেশিরভাগ সময় ঘরের ভেতরে থাকায় বারান্দায় খুব কম
যাতায়াত। বিগত কয়েকবছর ধরে নানা পাখির আসা-যাওয়া, একটা জিনিস লক্ষ্য করেছি—কাঁচ জিনিসটা
পাখিদের বেশ পছন্দের। দিনে কতবার যে জানালার কাঁচে ঠঠোকর দেয় তার ঠিক নেই! ওদের ককৌতুহলের
যেন শেষ নেই। এই নিয়মিত আসা-যাওয়ায় ওরাও লক্ষ্য করেছে আমার বাড়ির বারান্দা নিরিবিলি ও
নিরাপদ।
প্রথমে একটা সুন্দর ছছোট্ট সানবার্ড। সে বিগত ৩-৪ বছর ধরে নিয়মিত আসে, বাসা বানায় বারান্দায়। কী
সুনিপুণ তাদের বাসা! ওরা একদম ছছোট ছছোট কুঁটি সংগ্রহ করে, ঘন বুননে মজবুত বাসা বানায়। দেখে মনে
হয়, বেশ শ্রমসাধ্য কাজ, মনে হয় যেন আর্কিটেকচার বা ডিজাইনের এক নিখুঁত উদাহরণ—যেখানে স্থায়িত্ব,
নিরাপত্তা আর সূক্ষ্ম কারিগরি মিলেমিশে আছে। এ যেন সেই high-fidelity design, যেখানে প্রতিটি
উপাদান তার নির্দিষ্ট প্রয়য়োজনে নিখুঁতভাবে বসাননো হয়।
ইদানিং ঘুঘু পাখির আনাগগোনা বেড়েছে। প্রথমে একজজোড়া ঘুঘু এসে বাসা করল, ডিম ফুটিয়ে বাচ্চা দিয়ে ক
কোথায় হারিয়ে গেললো। বেশ কিছুদিন পর আবার দেখি আরেকজজোড়া হাজির! এবার ওদের বাসাটা ভাললো
করে লক্ষ্য করলাম—খুবই সাধারণ, মিনিমাল দৃষ্টিভঙ্গিতে তৈরি। অল্প কিছু খড়কুঁটি জজোগাড় করে, বেশ
ফাঁকা ফাঁকা একটা বাসা বানিয়েছে। প্রথমে দেখে মনে হয়েছিল, যাচ্ছেতাই করে বানাননো, কিন্তু পরে

বুঝলাম, ওদের উদ্দেশ্যই আলাদা। ওরা সানবার্ডের মততো দীর্ঘমেয়াদি পরিকল্পনায় যায় না—শুধু একটা
নিরাপদ জায়গা খুঁজে নেয়, ডিম পাড়ে, বাচ্চা একটু বড় হওয়া পর্যন্ত অপেক্ষা করে, ব্যস! আসলে এটা

এবার ভাবলাম, ডিজাইন ততো পাখিদের জীবনেও কতভাবে মিশে আছে! সানবার্ডের বাসা যদি হয় intricate

When Birth Belonged to
Women: Stories of Dais
and Displacement
#GenderEquality
“We did not have machines, but we had hands that knew. We watched the mother,
not the monitor. We sang to her, held her, stayed with her—not for money, but

because birth is not a job, it is a responsibility.” — Rokeya Bibi, retired dai from
Murshidabad district
Before hospitals, ultrasounds, and epidurals, childbirth across the Indian
subcontinent was a home affair, surrounded by women, rituals, and the indigenous
knowledge of the traditional midwives. These midwives, known as ‘dais,’ often lacked
formal education, yet it was their practiced hands that birthed generations of young
Indians. In regions like West Bengal, their role extended far beyond assisting in
births, they were integral to the cultural and moral upbringing of the child.
Unfortunately, as biomedical science grew by leaps and bounds, the local knowledge
systems were slowly marginalized, as is the case with most indigenous practices.
However, today, when there is a reawakening to the importance of well-rounded,
culturally-embedded care, these stories of midwives and their efficiency offer
profound lessons—not only about childbirth, but also about community, care, and the
underappreciated genius of women’s intuition. Across India, births were handled by
experienced midwives who had learnt their craft through apprenticeship rather than
training. These dais assisted in all stages of childbirth—from recognizing early signs
of labour, positioning the mother for comfort and ease, cutting and tying the umbilical
cord with a sterilized sickle—to guiding postpartum care for mother and the babies.
The skilled midwives were mostly from marginalized caste backgrounds, especially
in rural areas. Their position in the social fabric provided an interesting duality: they
were subjects of social stigma, yet essential—no baby could enter the world without
them to guide the process.
West Bengal: The Dai as Ritual Healer and Skilled Professional
In West Bengal, the traditional midwifery had its unique flavour. Here, the dais
operated not just as birth attendants but also as ritual guardians, particularly in the
districts of Birbhum, Nadia, and the 24 Parganas. They would often invoke deities,
especially Shashthi Maa, through songs and mantras to aid in and ensure seamless
childbirth. They would also instruct the use of ‘shital pati,’ cow dung-coated birthing
rooms, dietary restrictions, and body-wrapping both as a means of ensuring hygiene
and as signs of symbolic purity. In Bengal, childbirth was more than a medical

event—it was a passage drenched in social, cosmic, and emotional meaning. The
women viewed motherhood and its various steps as rites of transformation—a
shared experience savoured only by the women.
Dismantling a System Through ‘Modernisation’
As colonial and post-colonial views gained traction, midwifery was increasingly
viewed with suspicion. The British authorities advocated “clean” and “scientific”
methods of childbirth in institutional settings.
The newly independent India saw programmes like Reproductive and Child Health
(RCH) and Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) further institutionalise childbirth. Midwives
were pushed aside by auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), and modernization trampled
all over ancient knowledge. This shift brought with it social distortions, involving
aspects such as control, class, caste, and gender.
Once a woman-led affair, childbirth increasingly became a domain of male doctors,
hospital beds, and vertical hierarchies. However, there have been studies that show
institutional setups do not automatically ensure trouble-free births. Further, most rural
women are still apprehensive of the institutional set-up and miss out on the
postpartum care that dais provided for weeks, but is simply not an option with formal
systems.
A Future Where Both Worlds Can Meet
In recent years, however, there has been a renewed interest in traditional midwifery
knowledge and attempts to integrate it with modern maternal care. NGOs like
Chetna Manch and Sakhi Trust have spearheaded this movement. In West Bengal,
too, there are ongoing attempts by universities like Jadavpur University and
Viswa-Bharati to document and preserve the memories and skills of retired dais
before they are lost forever. In rediscovering the ancient genius of dais, we have also
learnt a few more things about the technique of midwifery—such as how dais were
often emotional anchors for first-time mothers, how ancient birthing process was a

community event surrounded by women, songs, and comfort, and most importantly,
how healing did not end with the birth of the baby—postpartum care was just as
important.
On a brighter note, India’s maternal mortality has indeed been steadily declining,
thanks to access to formal healthcare, but numbers do not tell the entire story. The
lack of culturally sensitive care, especially among marginalized communities, means
that there is still a substantial trust and compliance gap that needs to be bridged.
This can be done by integrating traditional knowledge into modern systems: where
midwives can be trained in obstetrics and traditional care, where safe home-births
are valid and supported options, and where postpartum care is again given the
importance it rightly deserves. Dais can become carriers and preachers of their dying
craft, therebyensuring that maternal care is not only safe but also deeply rooted in
cultural understanding.
The Wisdom We Left Behind
Traditional midwifery in India has different stories to tell. In West Bengal, for
example, these stories go far beyond childbirth, they are remnants of knowledge that
we overlook in our technology-centric approach to measuring care; they are
documentations of women’s wisdom, caste knowledge, and rural knowledge—of little
importance on paper, of great relevance in the workings of life. As India forges ahead
in healthcare innovation, revisiting these indigenous knowledge systems does not
mean we are moving backward. It means we are accepting all that was wise, human,
and healing, improving them with all the modern knowledge we possess now, and
letting this improved knowledge system guide us on our path ahead.

The Lost Art of Bengal’s
Nakshi Kantha
Embroidery
Stories Sewn into Fabric

When you hear about Nakshi Kantha, you might think it’s just an old quilt. But for
many of us from Bengal, it means something deeper. These are not just stitched
blankets-they hold stories. Real ones. About family, life, hopes, and
memories.Nakshi Kantha is part of our cultural heritage, especially in Bangladesh
and West Bengal. Women would take old clothes, usually worn-out saris, layer them,
and sew them together using a running stitch. That simple technique became
something special. Over time, this method turned into a style of embroidered
storytelling that has been passed down for generations.
What Makes Nakshi Kantha Special?
The name in itself says a lot. "Nakshi" means design. "Kantha" means quilt. It’s not
about using fancy materials. It’s about making something really meaningful from
what you have. People would reuse old clothes from their homes, and even the
threads that came from those clothes, to make something beautiful. The thread was
often pulled from old saris too. Every piece told a story - some about daily village life,
others about dreams, memories, or even big events from history.
The quilts often show scenes like women working in fields, fish in ponds, peacocks,
trees, birds,or religious icons. These floral and fauna motifs aren’t random or just for
show. They often carry meaning, like good luck, fertility, blessings, spiritual beliefs,
love, or memories. Some even show political changes, struggles from the pastor
personal loss.
Why Was It So Important?
For many women, Nakshi Kantha was a way to express what they couldn’t say out
loud. Most of them didn’t write in diaries. They stitched their thoughts instead.
Making these traditional quilts was also a way to support and bond with other women
in the community.
They made them for weddings, new babies, or to keep a loved one warm. Often,
they would pass down these pieces to children and grandchildren. They weren’t just
items. They were memories - a piece of someone’s life. In some families, a kantha

was the only thing a woman could call her own. It was something she made by hand,
and every stitch showed her care, time, and patience.
How It’s Made
Let’s keep it simple: You take a few old saris, stack them together on top of each
other, and sew them all around with tiny running stitches. The designs are usually
drawn by hand first using chalk or pencil. Then comes the stitching - slow, careful,
and full of meaning.
The process takes time. Weeks, sometimes months, depending on the size and
detail. That’s why each piece feels so personal. It reflects patience, love, and a quiet
sense of storytelling. It’s the kind of handcrafted textile work that doesn’t rush. The
stitches may look simple, but the patterns and the stories behind them are not. The
work often starts at the center and moves outward, like a ripple. This helps balance
the cloth and the design too.

What Happened to It?
So, why do people call Nakshi Kantha embroidery a "lost" art? A few things changed.
First, machine-made quilts and printed textiles took over the market. They're faster
and cheaper. That made many people forget the value of slow, handmade pieces.
Then there’s the shift in lifestyle. Fewer women artisans in villages are sitting down
to sew these. Many young people are moving to cities, chasing new careers, and

they no longer have the time or space to learn this craft. Even those who do make
Nakshi Kantha today may struggle to earn enough from it.
Some artisans worry that their work is being copied or used in ways that don't give
credit to the original makers. Others feel that mass production takes away the
meaning, love, and care behind each piece. These concerns are real. Women who
once made kantha for joy or love now make it for money, often due to their
situations. And that changes things.
Is There Hope?
Yes. There are signs of hope. People are starting to notice again. Some women are
trying new ideas, using symbolic designs that speak to today’s problems - like
climate change, migration, or personal stories of loss. They are still using recycled
fabrics, but the themes are modern. In some places, women are teaching each other
again. They’re forming groups where they can stitch together, share stories, and sell
their work. During a recent Durga Puja in Kolkata, a massive 100-foot kantha panel
showed off their skills and reminded people how valuable this art still is. There’s also
growing interest in using these quilts in other ways - as home decor, fashion, or even
framed wall art. That helps keep the craft alive and gives more women artisans the
chance to earn a living.
What do these quilts really show us?
Each piece of Bengal embroidery shows us more than skills or talent. It shows us
care. It tells us how someone lived, what they felt, and what they wanted to hold on
to. Whether it’s a spiral for the cycle of life or a fish to represent good luck, these are
symbolic designs that speak without using words.
Some quilts show a quiet day in the village - trees, ponds, animals, and family.
Others share deep emotions. A mother’s love. A daughter’s loss. A woman’s wish for
a better future. These aren’t just decorations. They’re messages from real lives. If
you pick up a real Nakshi Kantha, you’re not just holding a quilt. You’re holding
someone’s voice.

Final Thoughts
We don’t need to look far to see the value of old crafts. In the rush to get things
faster and cheaper, we often forget the beauty in slow, thoughtful work. Nakshi
Kantha reminds us of that. It reminds us to stop and listen to stories stitched
into fabric. To respect the hands that made them. And to pass those stories
forward. Let’s not let this art fade away. Let’s help keep these stitches - and
the stories inside them - alive.
